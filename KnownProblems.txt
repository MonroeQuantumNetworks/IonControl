* ScanParameters and ExternalScanParameters
	If a counter has multiple gates during one experiment, these are not considered different gates within an experiment but are treated like different experiments
	workaround: connect the signal to different counter channels and use those
	fix: define counter decimation to extract the first, second, .... gate of each experiment
