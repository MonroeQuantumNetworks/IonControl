\subsection{Overview}

\subsection{Registers}
The state machine has the following registers:

\begin{tabular}{r l}
W & Main work register \\
W1 & auxilliary work register \\
PC & code address \\
INDF & indirect memory address \\
shutter\_mask & mask for shutter values \\
shutter\_reg & shutter value buffer \\
counter\_reg & counter gate buffer \\
\end{tabular}


\subsection{Commands}

\begin{description}
\item[NOP] No operation
\item[DDSFRQ channel, {\it variable}] write frequency (32 most significant bits) from variable to DDS channel
\item[DDSFRQFINE channel, {\it variable}] write frequency (16 least significant bits) from variable to DDS channel
\item[DDSAMP channel, {\it variable}] write amplitude from variable to DDS channel
\item[DDSPHS channel, {\it variable}] write phase from variable to DDS channel
\item[DDSCHN]
\item[SHUTTER] 
\item[COUNT]
\item[COUNT1]
\item[COUNTBOTH]
\item[DELAY]
\item[LDWR {\it variable}] load value from variable into W register
\item[LDWR1]
\item[LDWI] load value from the address pointed to by INDF into W register
\item[STWR {\it variable}] store value in W register into variable
\item[STWR1]
\item[STWI] store value from W registerinto address pointed to by INDF
\item[LDINDF {\it variable}] load the contents of {\it variable} into the INDF register
\item[ANDW {\it variable}] W = W \& {\it variable}
\item[ADDW {\it variable}] W = W +  {\it variable}
\item[INC {\it variable}] W = {\it variable} + 1
\item[DEC {\it variable}] W = {\it variable} - 1 
\item[CLRW] W = 0
\item[CLRW1] W1 = 0
\item[CMP {\it variable}] Set W to 0 if W <= {\it variable} 
\item[CMP1 ]
\item[JMP {\it label}] Jump to {\it label}
\item[JMPZ {\it label}] Jump to {\it label} if W = 0
\item[JMPZ1 {\it label}] Jump to {\it label} if W1 = 0
\item[JMPNZ {\it label}] Jump to {\it label} if W != 0
\item[JMPNZ1 {\it label}] Jump to {\it label} if W1 != 0
\item[SHUTTERMASK {\it variable}] Set internal register shutter\_mask to {\it variable}
\item[ASYNCSHUTTER {\it variable}] Update internal shutter register, bits set in shutter\_mask are updated with the bits from {\it variable}
\item[COUTERMASK {\it variable}] Set the internal register with gate signals for the 8 counters and timestampers. Bits 7:0 gate counters 7:0, bits 15:8 gate timestamping on channels 7:0.
\item[TRIGGER {\it variable}] Set internal trigger register
\item[UPDATE  {\it variable}] Update shutters, counter gates, triggers and start the delay counter with the value in {\it variable}
\item[WAIT] wait until the delay counter expires
\item[LDCOUNT {\it counterchannel}] load the last counter value from {\it counterchannel} into W register
\item[WRITEPIPE] write the value in W into the pipe to the host computer
\item[READPIPE] read a value from the pipe from the host computer into the W register. If there is no new data in the pipe, the last value in the pipe is used.
\item[LDTDCCOUNT] load the value from the global tdc counter into W
\item[CMPEQUAL {\it variable}] compare W and {\it variable} and set the internal compare bit to true if W={\it variable}
\item[JMPCMP {\it label}] Jump to label if the internal compare bit is set
\item[JMPNCMP {\it label}] Jump to label if the internal compare bit is not set
\item[JMPPIPEAVAIL  {\it label}] Jump to label if the pipe from the host computer has data
\item[JMPPIPEEMPTY {\it label}] Jump to label if the pipe from the host computer is empty
\item[READPIPEINDF] Read the value from the pipe from the host computer in the INDF register
\item[WRITEPIPEINDF] Write the value from the INDF register into the pipe to the host comuter
\item[STOP] Stop execution
\item
